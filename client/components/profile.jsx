          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm a full-stack software engineer with background of 10+ years in graphic design. Having come from a creative background coupled with the analytical skills of a full stack developer, it's a synergy that is very rare and valuable. I believe itâ€™s an indispensable and vital asset for any company or organization to thrive and succeed in the future.
            <br />
            As an accomplished professional with multiple background demonstrating stellar adaptation and problem solving skills across multiple mediums, I have international work experience utilizing English and Korean bilingual ability in the workplace.
            <br />
            I love gaining new tools under my belt, to introduce the most up to date technology into all projects for a most affective and efficient solution possible.
